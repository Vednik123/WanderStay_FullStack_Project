# WanderStay 🏡

WanderStay is a full-stack web application inspired by Airbnb, built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. It allows users to list, update, and delete their properties, as well as leave reviews on specific locations. The app follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture and uses Cloudinary for image uploads. It is deployed on Render.
